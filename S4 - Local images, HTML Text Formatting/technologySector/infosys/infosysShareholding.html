    <h1>Infosys Shareholding Pattern</h1>
    <img src="../../images/Infosys_shareholding_pattern_Oct2024.jpg" width="400px" />
    <p>The shareholding pattern of Infosys as of October 2024 reveals a diverse and well-distributed ownership
        structure, demonstrating the company's appeal across a broad spectrum of investors. The shareholding mix
        includes significant stakes held by promoters, institutional investors (both domestic and foreign), mutual
        funds, and retail investors. This diversity is crucial in understanding how Infosys, one of India's leading IT
        services companies, is perceived in the market and the confidence various investor categories have in its
        long-term growth prospects.</p>
    <h2>Promoter Holding – 23.66%</h2>
    <p>Promoters hold 23.66% of Infosys’ shares, which, while not a controlling stake, represents a substantial
        involvement by
        the original founders or key management. Promoter holding in a company is an indicator of the founders' or
        leadership's
        confidence in the business. In the case of Infosys, this percentage reflects that the company’s leadership
        continues to
        have a vested interest in its performance and future. Historically, high promoter stakes are often seen as a
        sign of confidence, but an overly high percentage can sometimes
        raise concerns about corporate governance, as it might limit the influence of other stakeholders. Infosys’
        promoter
        holding strikes a balance, suggesting that while the leadership is deeply involved, the company is open to
        outside
        investment and influence, allowing for more diverse governance.</p>
    <h2>Mutual Funds – 29.44%</h2>
    <p>Mutual funds hold the largest percentage of Infosys shares at 29.44%, signaling strong confidence from
        institutional
        investors. Mutual funds pool money from various investors and invest in diversified portfolios, including shares
        of
        companies like Infosys. The large holding by mutual funds indicates that professional fund managers see Infosys
        as a
        reliable long-term investment, likely due to its stable growth, robust financials, and strong market position in
        the
        global IT services industry. This also reflects the stock's attractiveness to risk-averse investors, as mutual
        funds often invest in companies with
        solid fundamentals and growth prospects. Mutual fund holdings are typically viewed as a positive sign because
        they tend
        to take a long-term view of a company’s potential. The presence of such large mutual fund investments in Infosys
        suggests that market experts believe in the company's continued ability to generate returns and sustain
        profitability.</p>
    <h2>Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) – 17.16%</h2>
    <p>Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) hold 17.16% of Infosys shares. FIIs include entities like foreign banks,
        investment funds, and insurance companies that invest in the Indian market. This considerable stake indicates
        that
        Infosys is viewed positively by global investors. FIIs usually invest in emerging markets to diversify their
        portfolios
        and to capitalize on growth prospects that may be higher than in their home markets. Infosys, with its global operations and strong position in the IT services sector, is a natural choice for such
        investors. The company's consistent delivery of services, innovation in technology, and strong client relationships
        worldwide have made it attractive to international investors looking to gain exposure to India’s growing economy.
        Moreover, FIIs often have stringent investment criteria, meaning that their significant investment in Infosys is a vote
        of confidence in the company's leadership, corporate governance, and future growth potential. However, fluctuations in FII holdings can sometimes indicate broader market trends. For instance, global market
        volatility or changes in emerging market sentiment can lead to shifts in FII behavior. Despite this, the continued
        presence of foreign investors suggests Infosys remains a preferred choice for those looking for growth in the Indian
        market.</p>
        <h2>Other Domestic Institutions – 16.61%</h2>
        <p>Domestic institutional investors, which include Indian banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and other large
        domestic investors, hold 16.61% of Infosys’ shares. This shows a solid level of confidence from these institutions,
        which typically invest in companies with sound financial health and good governance practices. Indian institutions are known to have a more conservative investment approach, often focusing on stable companies with
        reliable dividends and consistent growth. Infosys fits this profile well due to its track record of delivering steady
        revenue growth, profitability, and dividend payouts. Moreover, the company’s leadership in the IT services sector and
        its continuous adaptation to changing technologies make it a safe bet for long-term investments.</p>
        <h2>Retail Investors and Others – 13.13%</h2>
        <p>Retail investors, which include individual shareholders, small businesses, and others, hold 13.13% of Infosys shares.
        Retail investment in a company like Infosys is significant, as it indicates public trust in the company’s performance.
        Retail investors often have different priorities compared to institutional investors, focusing more on immediate returns
        through dividends or short- to medium-term price appreciation. The presence of a substantial retail investor base also points to Infosys’ popularity among the general public. Over the
        years, the company has maintained its reputation for strong corporate governance, transparency, and consistent financial
        results, which are crucial factors for retail investors. Furthermore, the increasing ease of access to stock markets through digital platforms has brought more retail investors
        into the fold, many of whom look for reliable blue-chip companies like Infosys to grow their investments. This segment
        of shareholders also benefits from Infosys’ history of rewarding its investors through dividends and share buybacks.</p>
